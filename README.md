### 🤔 Why I Find This Interesting

This was the article linked in the first class's helpful guide, but it really resonates with me, even being over 20 years old. Joel Spolsky offers practical and often counterintuitive advice for CS students preparing to enter the tech world, emphasizing skills that matter beyond coursework. Spolsky highlights the importance of strong writing ability, a deep understanding of low-level languages like C, exposure to business fundamentals such as microeconomics, and not ignoring non-CS classes that build discipline and breadth. He also stresses taking programming-intensive courses and securing meaningful internships before graduating. It’s a refreshingly honest take on how to build a foundation that not only helps you get hired but also makes you effective in real software development environments, and in my experience, I've seen his advice to be true. Good fundamentals, strong breadth, and depth in programming are really key skills I've already noticed in my first 2.5 years.
