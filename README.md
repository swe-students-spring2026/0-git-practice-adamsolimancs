## My Interesting Read: Software Engineering & Decision-Making

### Article
**Title:** [*The Law of Leaky Abstractions*](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/)
**Author:** Joel Spolsky  

### Why I Find This Interesting

This was the article linked in the first class's helpful guide, but it really resonates with me, even being over 20 years old. Joel Spolsky emphasizes abilities that are important outside of the classroom and provides useful, sometimes paradoxical advice for computer science students getting ready to enter the tech industry. Clear communication skills, a thorough grasp of low-level languages (like C and C++), exposure to business foundations like microeconomics, and not disregarding non-CS classes that develop discipline and breadth are all important, according to Spolsky. Prior to graduation, he emphasizes obtaining worthwhile internships and enrolling in programming-intensive courses. It’s a refreshingly honest take on how to build a foundation that not only helps you get hired but also makes you effective in real software development environments, and in my experience, I've seen his advice to be true. Good fundamentals, strong breadth, and depth in programming are really key skills I've already noticed in my first 2.5 years.
